# Image_to_Knit
## Convert a black and white image into a three tone knitting pattern.

This is a silly little project I made for my sister. It will read in a .jpg or .png image file, reduces the image resolution, then converts the image into a knitting pattern.

Designed and tested with black and white imagery only. 

Output three-tone knitting pattern (white, gray, and black), with vissual pattern and text instructions.

Processing times may be long for high resolution images.

Happy knitting!
