# Image_to_Knit
## Convert a black and white image into a grayscale knitting pattern.

This is a silly little project I made for my sister. It will read in a .jpg or .png image file, reduces the image resolution, then converts the image into a knitting pattern.

Designed and tested with black and white imagery only. 

Output grayscale knitting pattern, with visual pattern and text instructions.

Processing times may be long for high resolution images.

Happy knitting!
